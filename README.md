# UFOs
##Purpose of trhe Analysis
In this analysis we are helping Dana, a data scientist to create a webpage for information on UFO sightings. For this purpose we filtered data based on certain criterias like date,city,state,country,shape and created it using JavaScript as the primary coding language. We also used HTML/CSS and bootstrap for aesthetic modification.
##Result

We created 5 filters. These filters help users get more precise information that they are looking for. 
##Summary
Even though this page gives a good amount of information to the users there may be a drawback to it. The user have to enter specific date, city, country or shape to get the data for those queries. For that they need to know when and where the sighting happened. This limits the usage of this webpage.
##Recommendations
Adding date ranges might help users get information even without entering specific details.
